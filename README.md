✔️ Digitizing medical records 🏥

✔️ Legal document analysis ⚖️


Google Document AI works in 4 major steps:

Step 1: Upload the Document

You upload your document to Google Cloud Storage or provide a direct file for processing. Supported formats:

📌 PDF, PNG, JPEG, TIFF

Step 2: Document Processing

Google Document AI analyzes the document using pre-trained ML models, detecting:

-Text

-Tables

-Key-Value Pairs

-Handwritten Data

Step 3: Extracting Structured Data

It classifies and extracts specific fields like:

✔️ Invoice Number

✔️ Date

✔️ Total Amount

✔️ Customer Name

✔️ Itemized Lists

Step 4: Output in JSON Format

The extracted data is returned as a JSON response, which you can integrate into databases, dashboards, or applications.
